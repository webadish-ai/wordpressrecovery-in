# Google Ads Strategy: WordPressRecovery.in

## 1. Campaign Structure
- **Campaign Type**: Search
- **Bidding Strategy**: Maximize Conversions (Target CPA if enough data)
- **Location**: India (all states, or focus on major tech hubs: Mumbai, Bangalore, Delhi, Hyderabad, Pune, Ahmedabad)
- **Language**: English
- **Landing Page Positioning**: India-only emergency WordPress recovery brand, backed by WebAdish LLP.

## 2. High-Intent Keywords (India)
Focus on "Emergency" and "Help" keywords where users are in a crisis.

### Group A: Emergency Recovery
- "hacked wordpress recovery india"
- "emergency wordpress help india"
- "wordpress site hacked fix"
- "malware removal service for wordpress india"
- "expert wordpress hack recovery"

### Group B: Google Blacklist / Warning
- "fix google blacklist wordpress india"
- "remove malware warning from site"
- "google says my site is hacked help"
- "deceptive site ahead fix wordpress"

### Group C: Specific Symptoms
- `"wordpress site redirecting to spam"`
- `"wordpress admin locked hacked"`
- `"wordpress hosting suspended malware"`

## 4. Negative Keywords (CRITICAL - Add these to prevent waste)
Add these as "Campaign Level" negatives:
- `free`, `tutorial`, `how to`, `course`, `job`, `salary`, `vacancy`, `download`, `nulled`, `plugin download`, `youtube`, `training`, `internship`.

## 5. Bidding Strategy (How to Fix Under-Spending)
**Problem:** If you are using Manual CPC and spending very little (e.g., ₹200/week), your bids are too low to enter the auction against competitors.
**Solution:** You have ₹20,000 in free credit that expires soon. You need to spend it to get data and leads.

*   **Primary Goal**: Spend the daily budget (₹600) efficiently to capture high-intent leads and utilize the promotional credit.
*   **Strategy**: Change to **Maximize Clicks**.
*   **Max CPC Bid Limit**: Set a cap of **₹120 - ₹150**.
*   **Why**: "Maximize Clicks" forces Google to find traffic, while the "Bid Limit" protects you from paying outrageous amounts (like ₹500/click) for a single click. Once you get 10-15 conversions, you can switch to "Target CPA".

### How to Fix "Domain webadish.com" issue in Google Ads:
When creating a new conversion action, Google might scan your account and suggest `webadish.com`. **Ignore the scan.**
1. In Google Ads, go to **Goals > Conversions > Summary**.
2. Click **+ New conversion action**.
3. Select **Website**.
4. Instead of letting it scan, scroll down and look for **"Add a conversion action manually using code"**.
5. Set the category to **Submit lead form**.
6. Set the conversion name to **WordPress Recovery Lead (IN)**.
7. Use the **GA4 Measurement ID (G-P4RW7GGCW8)** you already created.
8. Because the website is already sending `generate_lead` events to that GA4 ID, you can simply **Import** the conversion from GA4 into Google Ads.

### How to Import from GA4:
1. In Google Ads, click **+ New conversion action**.
2. Select **Import**.
3. Select **Google Analytics 4 properties (Web)**.
4. If your new GA4 property is linked to Google Ads, you will see the `generate_lead` event there. Select it and click **Import and continue**.
